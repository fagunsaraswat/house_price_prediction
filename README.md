I wrote a comprehensive review paper on existing house price prediction models as my 1st Semester Project. 
And after analyzing various algorithms, I produced a project that combines theoretical understanding from the review paper with tangible results through successful model implementation achieving an accuracy of 88.43% using Random Forest Regression.
